Project Abstract: 

Problem:  As a student, we face a lot of problems while enrolling in courses each semester. 
The plethora of options to choose from, the knowledge of our choices and their alignment with our interests confuse us all the more. 
And after all this the valid pre and corequisite choices also come up.After flipping through web pages, talking to people we gather all the data, but what we need is concrete information. COURSIFY aims to solve all these problems.


Proposed Solution:
Coursify had two major modules.
The feedback module is where students to provide feedback if they taken a course previously under a professor. This data helps in creating course plans for future students.
To create a course plan for themselves students need to provide required information as itâ€™s asked for. We have kept the process simple for you, you just have to select from the list of given options. Based on the provided inputs Coursify will generate a degree plan for a student.
